  * made ISO 8601 time format the default, closes: #279982, #299890
  * Debian has /etc/alternatives which the Gnome and KDE packages use

  * No more typos in configure.in, closes: #134722
  * Fix in upstream: as of xscreensaver 4.18, if it can't grab both the keyboard and
    mouse, it does not blank the screen.  This means that if you are
    running rdesktop or some long-keyboard-grabbing program, xscreensaver
    will never lock your screen until that grab is released.
    This is still bad, obviously, but perhaps it will confuse people less,
    and -- perhaps -- failing to lock at all is less bad than accidentally
    typing passwords at the wrong window, closes: #105995

  * Moved hacks to directory /usr/X11R6/lib/xscreensaver. This will not be
    a problem for the most part (except that the xworm hack is new just
    worm again), since xscreensaver adds this directory to the
    path. However, people running hacks by hand will have to add this
    directory to their path. (Closes: #92055)
